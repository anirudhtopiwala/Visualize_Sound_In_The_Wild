### Seattle Great Wheel
Giving a 360 view of Seattle, the ferry wheel gives outstanding views of the city at 60 ft elevation right above the Puget Sound. Although, its real beauty shines up in the night. Right next to the wheel is the Historic Carousel and Wings Over Washington. These landmarks are the first thing that comes to mind and when thinking of Seattle and so I wanted to merge these into one picture. The sound from the carousel varies the brightness of the amazing lights on the wheel making the image come alive. Also don't forget to admire at the reflection of the lights in the water.

### Instagram or Snapchat Filter?
This is a video of me with an existing Devil Horns Snapchat filter, but with my own way of encoding the music into the picture. See how the music [Some Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQkBeOisNM0) is encoded into the picture and makes the picture come alive. Does this look cool or what?  Would you want this as an Instagram or a Snapchat filter?

### Hiking Among The Trees
An early morning hike on the Mirror Lake trail in the woods of Mount Hood, Oregon. Somewhere among the trees, I was taking a break and lying down in the snow. It was here, I captured this picture and recorded the sound of chirping birds. The sound from the birds vary the brightness of the sky making the image come alive.

## The Mighty Multnomah Falls
Being the tallest waterfall in Oregon, listen in on 923 gallons of water falling over a height of 620 feet every second. The sound from the waterfall varies the brightness of the waterfall making the image come alive.

## Wine o'Clock
62 miles from downtown Portland, nestled right by the town of Mount Hood River is a very cute little winery Cathedral Ridge Winery. This picture is from a wine tasting one summer evening with a great ambiance. The beats from the ambiance vary the brightness of the beautiful amber string lights making the image come alive.

## Buzzing Bulb
Ever wondered why a bulb buzzes? This is mostly observed in dimmers where the bulb is constantly switched “on/off” to produce the dimming effect. As an effect of this, there is a constant application and removal of voltage which excites and cools the filament, causing vibration, which leads to the buzzing sound. Look closely at the filament in the picture. The brightness of the filament changes with the amplitude of the buzzing sound making the image come alive.
